## Victor's Garrido React Portfolio

I was given the task to create a Professional READ for the React website that will be used for the ASU coding BootCamp and beyond. I wanted to create a website that would demonstrate a template of a video tutorial. Of course, following along. There was a lot of practicality that is used with this project and its use cases in the future.

Being a web developer means being part of a community. This will be used a place in the internet where I can share current project and share project to fellow developers and collaborates on future projects.
